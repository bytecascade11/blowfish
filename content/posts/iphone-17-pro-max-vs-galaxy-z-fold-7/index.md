## Design and Build Quality

The **iPhone 17 Pro Max** feels refined and resolved. Apple returns to an aluminum frame that is lighter than titanium and better at heat dissipation. At 233g and 8.8mm thick, it feels dense but comfortable. Ceramic Shield 2 improves scratch resistance, and the IP68 rating means no concerns about water or dust.

The **Galaxy Z Fold 7** is Samsung’s biggest design leap in years. Closed, it’s thinner and lighter than expected. Open, it becomes a large tablet-like device with a dramatically reduced crease. The new hinge distributes stress more evenly and finally adds meaningful dust resistance with an IP48 rating.

**Quick take:**
- Reliability and peace of mind → **iPhone**
- Versatility and innovation → **Fold**

---

## Displays

Apple’s 6.9-inch Super Retina XDR OLED is one of the brightest and most color-accurate panels on any smartphone. Outdoor visibility is class-leading, and HDR content looks exceptional.

Samsung counters with two displays. The cover screen is now wide enough for comfortable typing, while the 8-inch inner panel transforms the experience entirely. Movies, documents, and multitasking feel far more natural on the Fold.

**Quick take:**
- Consistency and outdoor use → **iPhone**
- Immersion and multitasking → **Fold**

---

## Performance

Both phones run cutting-edge 3nm silicon.

The **A19 Pro** excels in single-core tasks and sustained gaming performance. The **Snapdragon flagship chip** in the Fold shines in multitasking and GPU-heavy workloads, helped by higher RAM options.

In daily use, both feel incredibly fast. Differences only emerge during heavy multitasking or extended gaming sessions.

---

## Cameras

Apple and Samsung take different approaches.

The **iPhone 17 Pro Max** focuses on reliability and video excellence. Stabilization, color accuracy, and ProRes recording remain unmatched.

The **Galaxy Z Fold 7** prioritizes still photography. Its high-resolution sensor delivers incredible detail and superior zoom performance beyond 5x.

**Quick take:**
- Video creators → **iPhone**
- Photography and zoom → **Fold**

---

## Battery Life and Charging

Battery life strongly favors the iPhone. Its larger cell and efficiency gains result in all-day—and often two-day—use for many users.

The Fold lasts a full day when used normally but drains faster during extended inner-screen sessions. Charging speeds are similar, though endurance is not.

---

## Software and Ecosystem

iOS remains tightly integrated, polished, and secure, with deep ecosystem benefits. However, it remains optimized for single-screen use.

Samsung’s One UI takes full advantage of the foldable form factor. Split-screen apps, floating windows, and DeX desktop mode make the Fold feel like a productivity machine.

Both brands promise **seven years of updates**.
