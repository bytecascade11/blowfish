The midrange smartphone market has evolved dramatically. What was once a **“compromise zone”**—where buyers had to choose between performance, camera quality, or design—has become one of the most competitive battlegrounds in the industry.

Tecno, a brand historically associated with entry-level and budget devices, has spent the last few years **quietly but aggressively redefining its image**. With the Camon series in particular, Tecno has aimed squarely at creators, photographers, and power users who want near-flagship features without flagship pricing.

The **Tecno Camon 30 Pro** is the clearest expression of that ambition yet.

On paper, it looks almost too good for its class: a **Sony IMX890 flagship-grade camera sensor**, a **144Hz AMOLED display**, and the powerful **MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate** chipset. After **two weeks of daily use**, including gaming, photography, video recording, and regular productivity tasks, here’s a deep, honest breakdown of what this phone does right—and where it still falls short.

## Design & Build: A Camera-First Identity

![Rear design of Tecno Camon 30 Pro showing circular camera module and Action Dot LED](tecno-camon-30-pro-design.jpg)

Tecno calls this design language the **“Classic Side-Axis Camera Design”**, and the inspiration is obvious. The large circular camera module, combined with subtle detailing, takes cues from vintage rangefinder cameras rather than modern smartphone minimalism.

### Materials & In-Hand Feel

Instead of glass, Tecno uses what it calls **Tech-Art Leather** on the rear. In daily use, this turns out to be a smart decision:

- It resists fingerprints and smudges exceptionally well  
- It provides better grip than glossy glass backs  
- It feels warmer and more comfortable during long gaming sessions  

The frame itself is plastic, not metal, but it’s well-finished and sturdy enough that it doesn’t cheapen the experience.

### The Action Dot: More Than a Gimmick

One of the most distinctive features is the **Action Dot**—a small red LED next to the camera module. Unlike typical notification lights, this one is deeply integrated into the system.

It lights up during:
- Video recording (acting as a tally light)
- Charging and fast-charging states
- Incoming notifications
- Voice assistant activation

You can customize or disable these behaviors in settings, which helps the feature feel **intentional rather than flashy**.

## Display: 144Hz Where It Actually Matters

![144Hz AMOLED display of Tecno Camon 30 Pro showing smooth scrolling and vibrant colors](tecno-camon-30-pro-display.jpg)

The Camon 30 Pro features a **6.78-inch AMOLED display** that punches far above what most people expect from a midrange device.

### Key Display Highlights

- **Refresh Rate:** 144Hz  
- **Panel Type:** AMOLED  
- **Eye Comfort:** High-frequency PWM dimming  
- **Color Profiles:** Vivid and Natural modes available  

The 144Hz refresh rate isn’t just a spec sheet flex. In daily use—scrolling, app switching, and gaming—it delivers a noticeably smoother experience than standard 120Hz panels.

Brightness levels are solid. While it doesn’t quite reach the peak brightness of ultra-premium flagships, the screen remains **perfectly legible under direct afternoon sunlight**, which is what matters in real-world usage.

Color tuning is another win. Out of the box, colors are punchy, but switching to the Natural profile results in a more accurate, balanced look suitable for photo and video editing.

## Camera Test: Sony IMX890 Doing Heavy Lifting

![Camera samples from Tecno Camon 30 Pro captured with Sony IMX890 in daylight and night scenes](tecno-camon-30-pro-camera.jpg)

The **Camon** name has always been synonymous with camera performance, and the Camon 30 Pro fully embraces that identity.

### Main Camera: Sony IMX890 (50MP)

The star of the show is the **50MP Sony IMX890**, a **1/1.56-inch sensor with OIS**. This is the same sensor used in several upper-midrange and flagship devices from 2024 and 2025.

#### Daylight Performance
In good lighting, the camera produces:
- Excellent dynamic range  
- Strong contrast without crushing shadows  
- Natural color reproduction without excessive saturation  

HDR is reliable and consistent, preserving cloud detail while keeping foreground subjects properly exposed.

#### Low Light & Night Photography
This is where the Camon 30 Pro truly separates itself from most competitors in its price segment.

Thanks to optical image stabilization, the camera can hold longer shutter speeds without introducing blur. Night Mode processing is restrained and intelligent—images stay clean without turning skies into grainy blue noise.

In fact, I found myself **leaving Night Mode enabled by default**, something I rarely do on midrange phones.

### Video Capabilities (A Major Win)

- **4K 60fps on rear camera**
- **4K 60fps on front camera**
- Effective HDR video support
- Combined OIS + EIS stabilization

The ability to record **4K 60fps video on the selfie camera** is still rare even among expensive phones, making the Camon 30 Pro an excellent option for vloggers and content creators.

## Performance & Gaming: Dimensity 8200 Ultimate in Action

![Gaming performance test on Tecno Camon 30 Pro showing PUBG and Genshin Impact gameplay](tecno-camon-30-pro-gaming.jpg)

Under the hood is the **MediaTek Dimensity 8200 Ultimate**, a chipset positioned at the very top of the midrange tier.

### Benchmarks & Stability

In synthetic benchmarks like AnTuTu, the device consistently scores **above 900,000**, placing it firmly ahead of most Snapdragon 7-series competitors.

More importantly, performance is **stable**.

### Real-World Gaming Performance

| Game | Settings | Performance |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| PUBG Mobile | HDR / Extreme | Locked 60 FPS |
| Call of Duty: Mobile | Ultra | 90–120 FPS |
| Genshin Impact | Medium–High | 45–55 FPS (stable) |

The **9th-generation vapor chamber cooling system** keeps temperatures under control. After a 40-minute Genshin Impact session, the phone was warm but never uncomfortable, and throttling was minimal.

## Software Experience: HiOS 14 on Android 14

HiOS has historically been one of Tecno’s weakest points, but **HiOS 14** represents a noticeable improvement.

- Cleaner UI design  
- Reduced pre-installed apps compared to older versions  
- Useful AI tools like **AI Erase** and smart gallery search  
- Advanced customization for the Action Dot  

While some bloatware still exists, most of it can be disabled, and day-to-day performance is smooth and reliable.

---

## Battery Life & Charging

The **5000mAh battery** delivers consistent all-day endurance, even with the 144Hz refresh rate enabled.

### Charging Speeds (70W Ultra Charge)

- **0–50%:** ~16 minutes  
- **0–100%:** ~45–50 minutes  

Fast charging is included **in the box**, which is increasingly rare and very welcome.
