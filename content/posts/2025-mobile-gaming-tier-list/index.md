This dramatically improves movement, aiming, and firing speed in competitive matches.

**PUBG Mobile**  
With extremely high touch sampling rates and finely tuned latency control, swipe-based aiming and camera adjustments feel instantaneous. In long-range engagements, this responsiveness translates into more consistent tracking and faster reaction windows.

**Genshin Impact**  
Genshin remains one of the toughest stress tests for mobile hardware. The ROG Phone 9 Pro is among the few devices capable of maintaining near-locked 60 FPS in dense environments and effects-heavy combat for extended sessions. The key factor is its external **AeroActive Cooler 9**, which uses active cooling technology to significantly reduce surface and internal temperatures during sustained load.

### Why It Excels in PUBG Mobile

The RedMagic 11 Pro features a true uninterrupted display by placing the front camera beneath the OLED panel. The result is a completely unobstructed field of view — a subtle but real advantage in *PUBG Mobile*, where spotting distant movement can decide a match.

**Active Cooling Advantage**  
An internal high-speed fan actively expels heat from the chipset area. This allows the phone to maintain peak brightness and performance longer than passively cooled devices, avoiding the aggressive thermal dimming seen on many mainstream flagships during long matches.

**Gaming-Centric Software**  
RedMagic’s Game Space environment allows per-game tuning of CPU, GPU, touch sensitivity, and even macro behavior. While not as polished as iOS, it offers unmatched control for players who like to fine-tune every variable.

### The Genshin Impact Experience

*Genshin Impact* is heavily optimized for iOS, and it shows. On the iPhone 17 Pro Max, players benefit from advanced rendering techniques such as **MetalFX Upscaling**, which intelligently balances visual quality and thermal output by rendering internally at lower resolutions and scaling efficiently.

**Consistency Over Peaks**  
While some Android devices may achieve higher momentary frame rates, the iPhone’s real strength is frame-time stability. Gameplay remains smooth with minimal stutter — an often overlooked factor that matters greatly during fast-paced encounters in *Call of Duty Mobile*.

**Audio Latency and Awareness**  
For competitive *PUBG Mobile* players, audio cues are critical. Apple’s tight integration between hardware, OS, and wireless audio reduces latency, allowing footsteps and gunfire to be perceived closer to real-time.
